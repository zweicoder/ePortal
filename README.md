# ePortal
A Summoning portal for files on eDimension. Sync files from courses on eDimension into your local folders.

Built on [Revenant](https://github.com/skewedlines/Revenant) and [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) as an experiment and practice with `node`.

### Usage
`node Revenant.js && node Incantation.js && node Portal.js`

### TODO
- Syncing instead of redownloading every time
- Support for multiple courses at once
- Main aggregated runner
- non- hardcoded inputs
- Usage / build info
